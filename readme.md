## Overview

This repository contains the research paper titled **"Advanced Phishing Techniques: Analyzing Adversary-in-the-Middle and Browser-in-the-Browser Attacks in Modern Cybersecurity."** This paper focuses on two of the most sophisticated and emerging phishing techniques: **Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)** and **Browser-in-the-Browser (BiTB)** attacks. Both of these methods have gained attention due to their ability to bypass traditional security measures such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), posing a serious threat to modern cybersecurity infrastructures.

By exploring these advanced phishing tactics, the paper aims to enhance the understanding of these attack vectors and propose actionable defenses against them.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are as follows:

1. **To analyze the techniques** used in Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) and Browser-in-the-Browser (BiTB) phishing attacks.
2. **To assess their effectiveness** in bypassing security measures like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
3. **To explore case studies** of recent AiTM and BiTB attacks to understand the real-world impact on industries such as finance, healthcare, and the public sector.
4. **To propose detection and mitigation strategies** to combat these advanced phishing techniques, leveraging modern cybersecurity tools like Zero Trust models and AI-driven threat detection systems.

## Research Significance

- **Timeliness**: AiTM and BiTB attacks have seen a significant rise in usage over recent years, as reported in major cybersecurity publications like Zscaler’s 2024 Phishing Report and Proofpoint’s 2023 State of the Phish. These attacks represent the latest trends in the ever-evolving phishing landscape.
- **Specificity**: The paper narrows its focus to these two specific phishing techniques, ensuring a deep and targeted analysis, avoiding the pitfalls of vagueness while covering emerging attack vectors that have not been extensively explored.
- **Industry Impact**: AiTM and BiTB attacks are especially relevant to industries like **finance**, **healthcare**, and the **public sector**, where attackers are increasingly targeting high-value entities and bypassing common defenses like MFA.
- **Actionable Solutions**: The paper provides **practical mitigation strategies** based on current technologies, emphasizing approaches like **Zero Trust security models** and **AI-driven threat detection** to counter these evolving threats.
